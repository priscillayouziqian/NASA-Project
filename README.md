# NASA API Project

This NASA API Project is built based on my previous [NASA toy project](https://priscillayouziqian.github.io/NASA-API/index.html), which I created while first learning to build websites. This updated app contains 4 sessions: 

* APOD - Astronomy Picture of the Day, 
* EPIC - Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera
* Mars Rover Curiosity Photos 
* Fun Facts about the space.

**Link to this app:** https://zy-nasa-1022.web.app/

## How It's Made

**Tech used:** HTML template, JavaScript, bootstrap, extenal API calls, firebase deployment

## Optimizations

* Speed up the fetching speed for images
* Expand database to include additional NASA API functoinalities

## Lessons Learned

Practiced API integration, dynamic content, front-end design, deployment and problem-solving with API rate limits.
